# Node Notes

## What is node?

Node is a way to run JavaScript on the command line. 


Once installed, you'll have access to three new commands:

- `node my-file.js` — runs the JavaScript in my-file.js
- `npm [subcommand]` — npm is a way to install 'packages' that your application depends on, such as the svelte package
- `npx [subcommand]` — a convenient way to run programs available on npm without permanently installing them
